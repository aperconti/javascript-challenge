In this activity I Used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, and wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

I included a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.

A date form was used in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that listens for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match the user input.

After completing this challange I went a little further adding a secound search criteria (city) in the level2 folder. I put in functions to cast the input as lowercase text to match the dataset structure which allows for greater ease of use by the users, allowing them to input the city name with capitals or lowercase and return the same results.
